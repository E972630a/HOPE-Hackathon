# MENTOR MIXER
MENTOR MIXER is a matching application that helps students or mentees find and match with a professional mentor or tutor. We created this application during our HOPE HACK 2020 Hackathon. MENTOR MIXER is meant to be used on desktops. The whole point for MENTOR MIXER is to make it easier for students to find someone who wil be able to assist them on subjects they are having difficulty with. The application consists of a landing page with a description of our application and a sign up button. On the signup page users will decide if they are searching for mentors or tutors. Within that form they will also be asked career interest, their mile radius to see how far they are willing to travel, and preffered language. From the sign-up the user will be redirected into their main content page which gives them a match of mentors or tutors.
